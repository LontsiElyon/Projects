 *
 * @section components 3. Product Components
 * @subsection hardware 3.1 Hardware Controllers
 * @subsection ESP32 Microcontroller
 * The ESP32 microcontroller is programmed to implement the Simon game. It sends game data via MQTT to the MQTT broker, which then forwards it to the backend application.
 *
 * Key Files:
 * - **main.cpp**: The main program file for the ESP32 microcontroller.
 *
 * @subsection backend 3.2 Backend Server
 * The backend is a Java application built using Vert.x, a toolkit for building reactive applications on the JVM. It exposes a REST API to interact with the Simon game data stored in the MariaDB database.
 *
 * Key Components:
 * - **MainVerticle.java**: The main entry point of the backend application.
 * - **ObjectController.java**: Handles HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate service.
 * - **ObjectService.java**: Contains the business logic for handling the Simon game data.
 * - **ObjectRepository.java**: Interacts with the MariaDB database to perform CRUD operations.
 *
 * @subsection frontend 3.3 Frontend Interface
 * The frontend is a simple web application built with plain HTML,Javascript and Bootstrap for styling. It interacts with the backend via AJAX requests to perform CRUD operations on the Simon game data.
 *
 * Key Files:
 * - **index.html**: The main HTML file for the frontend.
 * - **styles.css**: Custom CSS styles for the frontend.
 * - **app.js**: JavaScript for interacting with the backend via REST and WebSockets.
 *
 * @subsection database 3.4 Database
 * Relational database management system to store information about controllers, players, sessions, RFID reads, frontend assignments, and display updates.
 *
 * Key File:
 *- **schema.sql**: The Database file for storing Informations.

 *
 * @section challenges 8. Challenges and Solutions
 * @subsection latency 8.1 Challenge: Controller ClientID
 * - Problem: When Programming the Products ESP32Controller all the Controllers had thesame ClientID which made it impossible for several Controllers to be connected at thesame time. 
 * - Solution: Updating the main.cpp making it possible for each Controller to generate it's own ClientID.
 * @subsection integration_challenge 8.2 Challenge: Controller-Player connect
 * - Problem: Many players could connect to just one Controller which is not normal because one Controller was to be allocated to a Player.
 * - Solution: Enhancing our Server to verify in the Database if a connected controller is not in use brfore connecting it to a Player.
 * @subsection network 8.3 Challenge: Handling varying network conditions
 * - Problem: Due to network reasons a Controller could disconnect from the Server during the Game Process.
 * - Solution: Implementation of a reconnection mechanism and game state synchronization protocol
 *
 * This product development plan provides a comprehensive overview of the "Simon Goes Multiplayer" project, including the development process, key design decisions, testing strategies, and product features. It serves as a roadmap for the product's creation and a reference for understanding the choices made during development.
